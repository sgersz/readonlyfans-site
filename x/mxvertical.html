    <p class="mb-4">I never thought I’d ditch my trusty Logitech ultralight gaming mouse — until I tried the Logitech MX Vertical. After a few weeks of daily use, I can confidently say this is the most comfortable mouse I’ve ever owned.</p>

    <p class="mb-6">Here’s why the MX Vertical stands out — and why it might be worth a look even if you’re coming from the gaming world.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Comfort First: It’s Not Even Close</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">The MX Vertical is built for one thing above all: ergonomics. The vertical design puts your wrist in a natural handshake position, reducing strain during long hours at the desk. Compared to my ultralight gaming mouse, which was fast and nimble but flat, the MX Vertical feels like a relief to the hand.</p>
    <p class="mb-6">After a few days, I noticed less wrist tension — something no gaming mouse I’ve used has ever delivered.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Precision Where It Matters</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">Gaming mice are tuned for speed and ultra-high DPI, but for productivity, the MX Vertical hits the sweet spot. It’s got adjustable DPI (up to 4000), and the precision is plenty for creative work, spreadsheets, and even light gaming. It won’t win you a CS:GO tournament, but for everything else? It’s more than capable. I will add swapping the feet or adding the universal teflon feet fully unlock this mouse!</p>

    <hr class="border-purple-500 mb-6">

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Build Quality and Battery Life</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">Logitech nails the build. The MX Vertical feels solid, premium, and well-balanced in hand. The battery life is another win: up to four months on a full charge. That beats most wireless gaming mice, which often need charging every few days under heavy use.</p>

    <hr class="border-purple-500 mb-6">

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Only Negative: The Feet</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">If I had to nitpick, it’s the mouse feet. Unlike some high-end gaming mice that come with smooth Teflon feet, the stock feet on the MX Vertical are… fine. Not great. But here’s the good news: they’re easily replaceable with aftermarket Teflon feet, which turn the glide into pure butter.</p>

    <hr class="border-purple-500 mb-6">

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Final Verdict</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">If you spend long hours at a desk, the Logitech MX Vertical is a game changer. It’s the most comfortable mouse I’ve used, it delivers solid precision, and it’s built to last. Gamers might miss the ultralight flicks and RGB, but for everything else — productivity, creative work, or just browsing — the MX Vertical absolutely rules.</p>

    <hr class="border-purple-500 mb-6">

    <p class="font-semibold italic mb-2">TL;DR:</p>
    <p>If you value comfort and long-term wrist health, the MX Vertical is worth every penny.</p>
